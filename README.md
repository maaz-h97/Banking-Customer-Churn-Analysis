# Banking-Customer-Churn-Analysis
Customer churn analysis for a banking institution using predictive modeling techniques, feature engineering, and interactive Tableau dashboards for business insights.

## Overview

This project analyzes banking customer data to predict churn (attrition) behavior.  
Machine learning models were developed to classify customers based on likelihood to churn, and an interactive Tableau dashboard was built to visualize key churn factors and customer demographics.

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib)
- Tableau
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Steps

- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Building Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifiers
- Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall)
- Business Interpretation of Predictive Results
- Development of an Interactive Tableau Churn Dashboard

---

## Key Insights

- Random Forest classifier achieved an accuracy of ~86% in predicting customer churn.
- Inactivity, higher age, and multiple product ownership were key churn drivers.
- Customers with 4 products showed a 100% churn rate, signaling potential dissatisfaction.
- The Tableau dashboard allows business users to filter by demographics and churn status for better strategic decision-making.
